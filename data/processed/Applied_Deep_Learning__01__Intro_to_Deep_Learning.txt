Machine Learning as Alternative
Classical Programming quickly reaches its limits in certain situations ● Machine Learning can be a viable alternative to imperative programming
Training Machine Learning = Use data to answer questions
Inference
Terminology
Artiﬁcial Intelligence
e.g. knowledge- based systems
Machine Learning
e.g. linear regression
Representation Learning
e.g. neural networks

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning where agents learn through interactions with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.
This paper explores various machine learning (ML) techniques, including both classification and regression methods, which are essential for making predicted outputs based on data.
Furthermore, the study delves into neural networks – the backbone of deep learning – examining both traditional multi-layer perceptrons and advanced architectures such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks.
Applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and healthcare are highlighted, with a focus on the practical deployment of RL and ML techniques in real-world scenarios.
